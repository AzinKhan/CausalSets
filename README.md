# CausalSets

This is the code I used for calculating when writing my MSc on Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space-Time. These scripts are used to calculate the propagator of a massless scalar field on a causal set sprinkled into a spacetime of specified dimension and topology. This code is in need of a refactor (probably as a c++ project) and runs pretty slowly.
